<h2>W3C이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" title="html5">Following its formation</a> on 20 October, 
the W3C Board of Directors is pleased to have reached 
an agreement with MIT that transfers assets at MIT 
to <strong><u>World Wide Web Consortium</u></strong>, Inc.

</p> 
<p style="margin-top:25px;">The Web Consortium continues its mission to lead the web to its full potential by developing standards for an open and equitable web.
We are very pleased with the completion of this critical milestone in the World Wide Web Consortium’s transition to its own legal entity, set to launch in January 2023.</p>
More information will be available from our website in January.
